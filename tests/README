This directory contains ready to use and run tests and benchmarks. 
The benchmarks are also setup as tests, refer to the documentation for benchmark versions most suitable for simulations (without the overhead associated with testing).
Except for "examples" directory in geometry_testing and LBM_testing directory that needs to be updated all tests are automated and they pass. Users are highly encouraged to report any cases of failure.
