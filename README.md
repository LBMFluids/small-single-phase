# small-single-phase
Serial LBM implementation for small single phase scenarios.

## Notice

This code is now deprecated. The users are encouraged to use the code from ```sc_lbm``` repository which is more robust and not limitted to small problems. The ```sc_lbm``` has full functionality of this code and more. The code for single phase LBM is completed and tested and two-phase/two components (MCMP LBM) is currently being implemented (without breaking the single phase functionality). Next developments will include implementation of two-phase/single component systems and parallelization.
